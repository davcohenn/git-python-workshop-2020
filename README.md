# git-python-workshop-2020

A repository for learning git with Jupyter notebooks

## Setup
To work with this repository, click the green `Use this template` button at the top of the screen.  Make sure you create this repository _under your own account_!  Once your partner is assigned, decide whose repository the set of you will be using.  For the selected repo, go to the `Settings` tab and click `Manage Access`.  Add the GitHub username of the other partner.  The other partner should check their email and accept the invitation to collaborate.

For this workshop, we'll be using Vanderbilt ACCRE's JupyterHub cluster.  Log on at [https://jupyter.accre.vanderbilt.edu](https://jupyter.accre.vanderbilt.edu).  You'll need your VUNetID handy.

Follow the instructions provided, making sure to select Vanderbilt as your affiliation.  Use the defaults to spawn.

## Virtual environment
For this workshop, we'll be using a virtual environment that has already been created for you in another location.  Run the first two cells in the 00-setup.ipynb file to set up your virtual environment.  Refresh, and make sure you can select `git-python-workshop` under the `New` dropdown menu.  If that works, you're all set!
